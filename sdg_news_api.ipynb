During her fieldwork to understand the impact of global sustainability certifications on farmers, she met the mother of a local grower from India\\u2019s coffee cup. \\u201cShe asked me if I was going to do anything useful after my PhD,\\u201d  recalls Arshiya, who soon recognised that while it was wonderful to be so deeply immersed in an academic project, \\u201cit can be selfish if that was where it stayed.\\u201d This comment made her realise that much could be done to make coffee cultivation more sustainable \\u2014 something that is increasingly becoming an important aspect of the industry\\u2019s long-term viability, considering both the environmental impact of conventional coffee farming and the fact that the bean is particularly vulnerable to climate change. In 2014, after completing her PhD,  she returned to India, going on to start Black Baza two years later, naming the brand after a small, migratory raptor with \\u201cits own kind of cult following amongst birders, because it displays such interesting behaviours\\u201d. The beginnings were small: 100 kilograms  of coffee bought from four different farms. \\u201cNow, of course, that number has grown multifold, and we now work with around 650 farms (mainly in Palani, Wayanad and BR Hills),\\u201d  says Arshiya of the Bengaluru-headquartered \\u201cactivist company,\\u201d which has just won the Speciality Coffee Association (SCA) 2025 Sustainability Awards in the \\u2018For Profit\\u2019 category. This annual award, by the world\\u2019s largest global coffee trade association, recognises \\u201cexcellence in product innovation, design, and sustainability across the industry\\u201d with the winners (Fairtrade International won the \\u2018Nonprofit\\u2019 category) being formally recognised for their achievement at Speciality Coffee Expo in Houston in April. A selection of Black Baza\\u2019s coffees\\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \\n                                Special Arrangement Admittedly, the word \\u2019sustainable\\u2019 is a multifaceted, somewhat indefinable concept, with every organisation, brand, company, Government or country understanding the much-used term differently. \\u201cTherefore, we had to almost set our own standards for how we wanted to do things,\\u201d says Arshiya. Black Baza only works with smallholder farmers who have already been growing organic coffee and are committed to maintaining and improving the native forest cover on their farms. \\u201cThe average landholding on where we work is half-to-one-acre parcels of land in very remote parts of the country, with many belonging to tribal communities\\u2026 people who\\u2019ve been historically marginalised and are vulnerable,\\u201d says Arshiya, who has a background in community-led conservation. She adds that Black Baza also helps farmers with the post-harvest process, working very closely on building capacity to produce better quality, speciality coffee, both arabica and robusta. A coffee training programme being conducted \\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \\n                                Special Arrangement According to her, considerable care was taken to bring in a system of fair, transparent pricing, placing a premium on the coffee\\u2019s quality and the farming practices followed, including the attention paid to preserving the local biodiversity. Making coffee farms friendly to local flora and fauna, she says, is an especially crucial mandate of Black Baza since most coffee-growing areas are in places that are also rich in biodiversity. \\u201cThat is true across South and Central America, parts of Kenya, Uganda, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and the Indian Western Ghats too,\\u201d she says. Keeping with this focus on biodiversity, the names of all of Black Baza\\u2019s coffees, which are sold in compostable and degradable packaging, are inspired by various indicator species: organisms whose presence or absence offer insights into overall ecosystem health. Think potter wasps, lion-tailed macaques, otters, Indian moon moths, or the Malabar whistling thrush, \\u201cspecies symbolic of the kind of farming practices we like,\\u201d she says. One of Black Baza\\u2019s partners with her produce\\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \\n                                Special Arrangement The popular belief is that coffee came to India in the 17th Century surreptitiously, smuggled from Yemen by the Sufi saint Baba Budan.  \\u201cIt is a sweet story, but that is not really how coffee became a full-fledged plantation industry. It was a colonial project,\\u201d says Arshiya, who, as part of her PhD work, spent a lot of her time in the British Library looking at archives to understand how coffee spread in India. \\u201cWe know that it was the British East India Company that set up an experimental plot in Thalassery, Kerala, and expanded coffee across India from there.\\u201d This expansion, however, came at a considerable ecological cost, with the British clearing vast hills to grow this coffee, later replanting the land with exotic species like silver oak, once they realised that coffee grew better in shade. \\u201cAnd when they left, they handed over their plantations to their favourite people. And that is where this land inequality came about,\\u201d she says. While coffee continues to be grown in large plantations, many coffee farmers cultivate coffee on very small tracts of land, making them especially vulnerable to the vagaries of Nature, including climate change, since coffee is especially susceptible to rising temperatures and rainfall pattern fluctuations. \\u201cSmallholder farmers are always more vulnerable in the face of any kind of natural disaster, and that is true of coffee as well,\\u201d she says.

April 21, 2025e-Paper Updated- April 21, 2025 10:03 am IST - Bengaluru Aghanashini Estuary in Uttara Kannada is one of the Ramsar sites.\\n                                          | Photo Credit: file photo Secretary General of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, Dr. Musonda Mumba, on Sunday said that India has more Ramsar sites compared to China. Dr. Mumba, participating in the Sinhasi Social Impact Conference 2 - Wetland Conservation and Climate Change, said India now has 89 Ramsar sites surpassing China which has 82 sites. \\u201cIndia now has 89 Ramsar sites, surpassing China, which has 82 Ramsar sites. The wetland sites range from mountains to the sea,\\u201d Dr. Mumba said. Speaking on the importance of wetlands, she said that they have tremendous value almost all of the world\\u2019s fresh water is drawn from them. \\u201cWetlands are the world\\u2019s largest carbon shore, they purify and filter harmful water, our food supply depends on wetlands, extreme climatic events are mitigated by wetlands, wetlands provide jobs and sustainable livelihoods, almost half of all animal species live and breed in wetlands,\\u201d she said. On the challenges faced by them and the importance of Ramsar Sites, she said there are 2,500 sites covering over 257 million hectares around the world. \\u201cThe challenge for wetlands is that they have been used historically as waste lands; as a result of this, they are being lost at an alarming rate. Around 87% of wetlands have been lost since 1700 AD. Around 35% of wetlands have been lost since 1970,\\u201d she added. She further pointed out that wetlands are being lost at a rate of three times faster than tropical forests. \\u201cAround 4,875 wetland-dependent species are threatened with extinction globally. Over 80% of wastewater is released into wetlands immediate action is required to stop this,\\u201d she said. Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest, Karnataka Forest Department, Kumar Pushkar, speaking on the occasion, said that according to the National Wetlands Atlas 2021, Karnataka has 14,936 wetlands covering 0.79 million hectares, which is 4.1% of the State\\u2019s geographical area. \\u201cWith population rising in the State, especially urban Bengaluru and nearby periurban areas like Doddaballapur, the demand for water has increased manifold. This, together with the dried-up or polluted nature of water bodies, has put high pressure on the city\\u2019s underground water table, which is now found at depths of 1500 feet in many parts. The Karnataka Forest Department is undertaking various activities for conservation and management of wetlands under its jurisdiction in Karnataka,\\u201d he said. He added that there has not been much change in the state\\u2019s wetland geographical area which is a good indicator.

April 16, 2025e-Paper Updated- April 16, 2025 04:55 pm IST Coffee being dried in a remote hamlet\\n                                          | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement Arshiya Bose feels that a conversation she had in Coorg, back in 2011, when she was pursuing her PhD at Cambridge, was a \\u201cpivotal moment\\u201d in her journey towards creating Black Baza Coffee. During her fieldwork to understand the impact of global sustainability certifications on farmers, she met the mother of a local grower from India\\u2019s coffee cup. \\u201cShe asked me if I was going to do anything useful after my PhD,\\u201d  recalls Arshiya, who soon recognised that while it was wonderful to be so deeply immersed in an academic project, \\u201cit can be selfish if that was where it stayed.\\u201d This comment made her realise that much could be done to make coffee cultivation more sustainable \\u2014 something that is increasingly becoming an important aspect of the industry\\u2019s long-term viability, considering both the environmental impact of conventional coffee farming and the fact that the bean is particularly vulnerable to climate change. In 2014, after completing her PhD,  she returned to India, going on to start Black Baza two years later, naming the brand after a small, migratory raptor with \\u201cits own kind of cult following amongst birders, because it displays such interesting behaviours\\u201d. The beginnings were small: 100 kilograms  of coffee bought from four different farms. \\u201cNow, of course, that number has grown multifold, and we now work with around 650 farms (mainly in Palani, Wayanad and BR Hills),\\u201d  says Arshiya of the Bengaluru-headquartered \\u201cactivist company,\\u201d which has just won the Speciality Coffee Association (SCA) 2025 Sustainability Awards in the \\u2018For Profit\\u2019 category. This annual award, by the world\\u2019s largest global coffee trade association, recognises \\u201cexcellence in product innovation, design, and sustainability across the industry\\u201d with the winners (Fairtrade International won the \\u2018Nonprofit\\u2019 category) being formally recognised for their achievement at Speciality Coffee Expo in Houston in April. A selection of Black Baza\\u2019s coffees\\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \\n                                Special Arrangement Admittedly, the word \\u2019sustainable\\u2019 is a multifaceted, somewhat indefinable concept, with every organisation, brand, company, Government or country understanding the much-used term differently. \\u201cTherefore, we had to almost set our own standards for how we wanted to do things,\\u201d says Arshiya. Black Baza only works with smallholder farmers who have already been growing organic coffee and are committed to maintaining and improving the native forest cover on their farms. \\u201cThe average landholding on where we work is half-to-one-acre parcels of land in very remote parts of the country, with many belonging to tribal communities\\u2026 people who\\u2019ve been historically marginalised and are vulnerable,\\u201d says Arshiya, who has a background in community-led conservation. She adds that Black Baza also helps farmers with the post-harvest process, working very closely on building capacity to produce better quality, speciality coffee, both arabica and robusta. A coffee training programme being conducted \\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \\n                                Special Arrangement According to her, considerable care was taken to bring in a system of fair, transparent pricing, placing a premium on the coffee\\u2019s quality and the farming practices followed, including the attention paid to preserving the local biodiversity. Making coffee farms friendly to local flora and fauna, she says, is an especially crucial mandate of Black Baza since most coffee-growing areas are in places that are also rich in biodiversity. \\u201cThat is true across South and Central America, parts of Kenya, Uganda, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and the Indian Western Ghats too,\\u201d she says. Keeping with this focus on biodiversity, the names of all of Black Baza\\u2019s coffees, which are sold in compostable and degradable packaging, are inspired by various indicator species: organisms whose presence or absence offer insights into overall ecosystem health. Think potter wasps, lion-tailed macaques, otters, Indian moon moths, or the Malabar whistling thrush, \\u201cspecies symbolic of the kind of farming practices we like,\\u201d she says. One of Black Baza\\u2019s partners with her produce\\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \\n                                Special Arrangement The popular belief is that coffee came to India in the 17th Century surreptitiously, smuggled from Yemen by the Sufi saint Baba Budan.  \\u201cIt is a sweet story, but that is not really how coffee became a full-fledged plantation industry. It was a colonial project,\\u201d says Arshiya, who, as part of her PhD work, spent a lot of her time in the British Library looking at archives to understand how coffee spread in India. \\u201cWe know that it was the British East India Company that set up an experimental plot in Thalassery, Kerala, and expanded coffee across India from there.\\u201d This expansion, however, came at a considerable ecological cost, with the British clearing vast hills to grow this coffee, later replanting the land with exotic species like silver oak, once they realised that coffee grew better in shade. \\u201cAnd when they left, they handed over their plantations to their favourite people. And that is where this land inequality came about,\\u201d she says. While coffee continues to be grown in large plantations, many coffee farmers cultivate coffee on very small tracts of land, making them especially vulnerable to the vagaries of Nature, including climate change, since coffee is especially susceptible to rising temperatures and rainfall pattern fluctuations. \\u201cSmallholder farmers are always more vulnerable in the face of any kind of natural disaster, and that is true of coffee as well,\\u201d she says. Arshiya Bose\\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \\n                                Special Arrangement Working with more farmers, therefore, is high on the list of Black Baza\\u2019s priorities, and Arshiya hopes that the recent SCA recognition can help them achieve this goal. \\u201cOne of the ways we think of doing this is to develop a green coffee programme, and I think something like SCA enables us to now try to  look for partners overseas,\\u201d she says, adding that getting into coffee exports would allow them to work with even more farmers. \\u201cWe have also started expanding beyond coffee into other products that our farmers grow, including cardamom and pepper, and hope to open a couple of caf\\u00e9s soon, as well.\\u201d To know more, log intohttps://blackbazacoffee.com/ Published- April 16, 2025 04:33 pm IST climate change/Sustainability/conservation/community-led Copyright\\u00a9 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

April 21, 2025e-Paper Updated- April 21, 2025 10:03 am IST - Bengaluru Aghanashini Estuary in Uttara Kannada is one of the Ramsar sites.\\n                                          | Photo Credit: file photo Secretary General of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, Dr. Musonda Mumba, on Sunday said that India has more Ramsar sites compared to China. Dr. Mumba, participating in the Sinhasi Social Impact Conference 2 - Wetland Conservation and Climate Change, said India now has 89 Ramsar sites surpassing China which has 82 sites. \\u201cIndia now has 89 Ramsar sites, surpassing China, which has 82 Ramsar sites. The wetland sites range from mountains to the sea,\\u201d Dr. Mumba said. Speaking on the importance of wetlands, she said that they have tremendous value almost all of the world\\u2019s fresh water is drawn from them. \\u201cWetlands are the world\\u2019s largest carbon shore, they purify and filter harmful water, our food supply depends on wetlands, extreme climatic events are mitigated by wetlands, wetlands provide jobs and sustainable livelihoods, almost half of all animal species live and breed in wetlands,\\u201d she said. On the challenges faced by them and the importance of Ramsar Sites, she said there are 2,500 sites covering over 257 million hectares around the world. \\u201cThe challenge for wetlands is that they have been used historically as waste lands; as a result of this, they are being lost at an alarming rate. Around 87% of wetlands have been lost since 1700 AD. Around 35% of wetlands have been lost since 1970,\\u201d she added. She further pointed out that wetlands are being lost at a rate of three times faster than tropical forests. \\u201cAround 4,875 wetland-dependent species are threatened with extinction globally. Over 80% of wastewater is released into wetlands immediate action is required to stop this,\\u201d she said. Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest, Karnataka Forest Department, Kumar Pushkar, speaking on the occasion, said that according to the National Wetlands Atlas 2021, Karnataka has 14,936 wetlands covering 0.79 million hectares, which is 4.1% of the State\\u2019s geographical area. \\u201cWith population rising in the State, especially urban Bengaluru and nearby periurban areas like Doddaballapur, the demand for water has increased manifold. This, together with the dried-up or polluted nature of water bodies, has put high pressure on the city\\u2019s underground water table, which is now found at depths of 1500 feet in many parts. The Karnataka Forest Department is undertaking various activities for conservation and management of wetlands under its jurisdiction in Karnataka,\\u201d he said. He added that there has not been much change in the state\\u2019s wetland geographical area which is a good indicator.

April 16, 2025e-Paper Updated- April 16, 2025 04:55 pm IST Coffee being dried in a remote hamlet\\n                                          | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement Arshiya Bose feels that a conversation she had in Coorg, back in 2011, when she was pursuing her PhD at Cambridge, was a \\u201cpivotal moment\\u201d in her journey towards creating Black Baza Coffee. During her fieldwork to understand the impact of global sustainability certifications on farmers, she met the mother of a local grower from India\\u2019s coffee cup. \\u201cShe asked me if I was going to do anything useful after my PhD,\\u201d  recalls Arshiya, who soon recognised that while it was wonderful to be so deeply immersed in an academic project, \\u201cit can be selfish if that was where it stayed.\\u201d This comment made her realise that much could be done to make coffee cultivation more sustainable \\u2014 something that is increasingly becoming an important aspect of the industry\\u2019s long-term viability, considering both the environmental impact of conventional coffee farming and the fact that the bean is particularly vulnerable to climate change. In 2014, after completing her PhD,  she returned to India, going on to start Black Baza two years later, naming the brand after a small, migratory raptor with \\u201cits own kind of cult following amongst birders, because it displays such interesting behaviours\\u201d. The beginnings were small: 100 kilograms  of coffee bought from four different farms. \\u201cNow, of course, that number has grown multifold, and we now work with around 650 farms (mainly in Palani, Wayanad and BR Hills),\\u201d  says Arshiya of the Bengaluru-headquartered \\u201cactivist company,\\u201d which has just won the Speciality Coffee Association (SCA) 2025 Sustainability Awards in the \\u2018For Profit\\u2019 category. This annual award, by the world\\u2019s largest global coffee trade association, recognises \\u201cexcellence in product innovation, design, and sustainability across the industry\\u201d with the winners (Fairtrade International won the \\u2018Nonprofit\\u2019 category) being formally recognised for their achievement at Speciality Coffee Expo in Houston in April. A selection of Black Baza\\u2019s coffees\\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \\n                                Special Arrangement Admittedly, the word \\u2019sustainable\\u2019 is a multifaceted, somewhat indefinable concept, with every organisation, brand, company, Government or country understanding the much-used term differently. \\u201cTherefore, we had to almost set our own standards for how we wanted to do things,\\u201d says Arshiya. Black Baza only works with smallholder farmers who have already been growing organic coffee and are committed to maintaining and improving the native forest cover on their farms. \\u201cThe average landholding on where we work is half-to-one-acre parcels of land in very remote parts of the country, with many belonging to tribal communities\\u2026 people who\\u2019ve been historically marginalised and are vulnerable,\\u201d says Arshiya, who has a background in community-led conservation. She adds that Black Baza also helps farmers with the post-harvest process, working very closely on building capacity to produce better quality, speciality coffee, both arabica and robusta. A coffee training programme being conducted \\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \\n                                Special Arrangement According to her, considerable care was taken to bring in a system of fair, transparent pricing, placing a premium on the coffee\\u2019s quality and the farming practices followed, including the attention paid to preserving the local biodiversity. Making coffee farms friendly to local flora and fauna, she says, is an especially crucial mandate of Black Baza since most coffee-growing areas are in places that are also rich in biodiversity. \\u201cThat is true across South and Central America, parts of Kenya, Uganda, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and the Indian Western Ghats too,\\u201d she says. Keeping with this focus on biodiversity, the names of all of Black Baza\\u2019s coffees, which are sold in compostable and degradable packaging, are inspired by various indicator species: organisms whose presence or absence offer insights into overall ecosystem health. Think potter wasps, lion-tailed macaques, otters, Indian moon moths, or the Malabar whistling thrush, \\u201cspecies symbolic of the kind of farming practices we like,\\u201d she says. One of Black Baza\\u2019s partners with her produce\\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \\n                                Special Arrangement The popular belief is that coffee came to India in the 17th Century surreptitiously, smuggled from Yemen by the Sufi saint Baba Budan.  \\u201cIt is a sweet story, but that is not really how coffee became a full-fledged plantation industry. It was a colonial project,\\u201d says Arshiya, who, as part of her PhD work, spent a lot of her time in the British Library looking at archives to understand how coffee spread in India. \\u201cWe know that it was the British East India Company that set up an experimental plot in Thalassery, Kerala, and expanded coffee across India from there.\\u201d This expansion, however, came at a considerable ecological cost, with the British clearing vast hills to grow this coffee, later replanting the land with exotic species like silver oak, once they realised that coffee grew better in shade. \\u201cAnd when they left, they handed over their plantations to their favourite people. And that is where this land inequality came about,\\u201d she says. While coffee continues to be grown in large plantations, many coffee farmers cultivate coffee on very small tracts of land, making them especially vulnerable to the vagaries of Nature, including climate change, since coffee is especially susceptible to rising temperatures and rainfall pattern fluctuations. \\u201cSmallholder farmers are always more vulnerable in the face of any kind of natural disaster, and that is true of coffee as well,\\u201d she says. Arshiya Bose\\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \\n                                Special Arrangement Working with more farmers, therefore, is high on the list of Black Baza\\u2019s priorities, and Arshiya hopes that the recent SCA recognition can help them achieve this goal. \\u201cOne of the ways we think of doing this is to develop a green coffee programme, and I think something like SCA enables us to now try to  look for partners overseas,\\u201d she says, adding that getting into coffee exports would allow them to work with even more farmers. \\u201cWe have also started expanding beyond coffee into other products that our farmers grow, including cardamom and pepper, and hope to open a couple of caf\\u00e9s soon, as well.\\u201d To know more, log intohttps://blackbazacoffee.com/ Published- April 16, 2025 04:33 pm IST climate change/Sustainability/conservation/community-led Copyright\\u00a9 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

April 21, 2025e-Paper Updated- April 21, 2025 10:03 am IST - Bengaluru Aghanashini Estuary in Uttara Kannada is one of the Ramsar sites.\\n                                          | Photo Credit: file photo Secretary General of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, Dr. Musonda Mumba, on Sunday said that India has more Ramsar sites compared to China. Dr. Mumba, participating in the Sinhasi Social Impact Conference 2 - Wetland Conservation and Climate Change, said India now has 89 Ramsar sites surpassing China which has 82 sites. \\u201cIndia now has 89 Ramsar sites, surpassing China, which has 82 Ramsar sites. The wetland sites range from mountains to the sea,\\u201d Dr. Mumba said. Speaking on the importance of wetlands, she said that they have tremendous value almost all of the world\\u2019s fresh water is drawn from them. \\u201cWetlands are the world\\u2019s largest carbon shore, they purify and filter harmful water, our food supply depends on wetlands, extreme climatic events are mitigated by wetlands, wetlands provide jobs and sustainable livelihoods, almost half of all animal species live and breed in wetlands,\\u201d she said. On the challenges faced by them and the importance of Ramsar Sites, she said there are 2,500 sites covering over 257 million hectares around the world. \\u201cThe challenge for wetlands is that they have been used historically as waste lands; as a result of this, they are being lost at an alarming rate. Around 87% of wetlands have been lost since 1700 AD. Around 35% of wetlands have been lost since 1970,\\u201d she added. She further pointed out that wetlands are being lost at a rate of three times faster than tropical forests. \\u201cAround 4,875 wetland-dependent species are threatened with extinction globally. Over 80% of wastewater is released into wetlands immediate action is required to stop this,\\u201d she said. Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest, Karnataka Forest Department, Kumar Pushkar, speaking on the occasion, said that according to the National Wetlands Atlas 2021, Karnataka has 14,936 wetlands covering 0.79 million hectares, which is 4.1% of the State\\u2019s geographical area. \\u201cWith population rising in the State, especially urban Bengaluru and nearby periurban areas like Doddaballapur, the demand for water has increased manifold. This, together with the dried-up or polluted nature of water bodies, has put high pressure on the city\\u2019s underground water table, which is now found at depths of 1500 feet in many parts. The Karnataka Forest Department is undertaking various activities for conservation and management of wetlands under its jurisdiction in Karnataka,\\u201d he said. He added that there has not been much change in the state\\u2019s wetland geographical area which is a good indicator.

April 16, 2025e-Paper Updated- April 16, 2025 04:55 pm IST Coffee being dried in a remote hamlet\\n                                          | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement Arshiya Bose feels that a conversation she had in Coorg, back in 2011, when she was pursuing her PhD at Cambridge, was a \\u201cpivotal moment\\u201d in her journey towards creating Black Baza Coffee. During her fieldwork to understand the impact of global sustainability certifications on farmers, she met the mother of a local grower from India\\u2019s coffee cup. \\u201cShe asked me if I was going to do anything useful after my PhD,\\u201d  recalls Arshiya, who soon recognised that while it was wonderful to be so deeply immersed in an academic project, \\u201cit can be selfish if that was where it stayed.\\u201d This comment made her realise that much could be done to make coffee cultivation more sustainable \\u2014 something that is increasingly becoming an important aspect of the industry\\u2019s long-term viability, considering both the environmental impact of conventional coffee farming and the fact that the bean is particularly vulnerable to climate change. In 2014, after completing her PhD,  she returned to India, going on to start Black Baza two years later, naming the brand after a small, migratory raptor with \\u201cits own kind of cult following amongst birders, because it displays such interesting behaviours\\u201d. The beginnings were small: 100 kilograms  of coffee bought from four different farms. \\u201cNow, of course, that number has grown multifold, and we now work with around 650 farms (mainly in Palani, Wayanad and BR Hills),\\u201d  says Arshiya of the Bengaluru-headquartered \\u201cactivist company,\\u201d which has just won the Speciality Coffee Association (SCA) 2025 Sustainability Awards in the \\u2018For Profit\\u2019 category. This annual award, by the world\\u2019s largest global coffee trade association, recognises \\u201cexcellence in product innovation, design, and sustainability across the industry\\u201d with the winners (Fairtrade International won the \\u2018Nonprofit\\u2019 category) being formally recognised for their achievement at Speciality Coffee Expo in Houston in April. A selection of Black Baza\\u2019s coffees\\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \\n                                Special Arrangement Admittedly, the word \\u2019sustainable\\u2019 is a multifaceted, somewhat indefinable concept, with every organisation, brand, company, Government or country understanding the much-used term differently. \\u201cTherefore, we had to almost set our own standards for how we wanted to do things,\\u201d says Arshiya. Black Baza only works with smallholder farmers who have already been growing organic coffee and are committed to maintaining and improving the native forest cover on their farms. \\u201cThe average landholding on where we work is half-to-one-acre parcels of land in very remote parts of the country, with many belonging to tribal communities\\u2026 people who\\u2019ve been historically marginalised and are vulnerable,\\u201d says Arshiya, who has a background in community-led conservation. She adds that Black Baza also helps farmers with the post-harvest process, working very closely on building capacity to produce better quality, speciality coffee, both arabica and robusta. A coffee training programme being conducted \\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \\n                                Special Arrangement According to her, considerable care was taken to bring in a system of fair, transparent pricing, placing a premium on the coffee\\u2019s quality and the farming practices followed, including the attention paid to preserving the local biodiversity. Making coffee farms friendly to local flora and fauna, she says, is an especially crucial mandate of Black Baza since most coffee-growing areas are in places that are also rich in biodiversity. \\u201cThat is true across South and Central America, parts of Kenya, Uganda, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and the Indian Western Ghats too,\\u201d she says. Keeping with this focus on biodiversity, the names of all of Black Baza\\u2019s coffees, which are sold in compostable and degradable packaging, are inspired by various indicator species: organisms whose presence or absence offer insights into overall ecosystem health. Think potter wasps, lion-tailed macaques, otters, Indian moon moths, or the Malabar whistling thrush, \\u201cspecies symbolic of the kind of farming practices we like,\\u201d she says. One of Black Baza\\u2019s partners with her produce\\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \\n                                Special Arrangement The popular belief is that coffee came to India in the 17th Century surreptitiously, smuggled from Yemen by the Sufi saint Baba Budan.  \\u201cIt is a sweet story, but that is not really how coffee became a full-fledged plantation industry. It was a colonial project,\\u201d says Arshiya, who, as part of her PhD work, spent a lot of her time in the British Library looking at archives to understand how coffee spread in India. \\u201cWe know that it was the British East India Company that set up an experimental plot in Thalassery, Kerala, and expanded coffee across India from there.\\u201d This expansion, however, came at a considerable ecological cost, with the British clearing vast hills to grow this coffee, later replanting the land with exotic species like silver oak, once they realised that coffee grew better in shade. \\u201cAnd when they left, they handed over their plantations to their favourite people. And that is where this land inequality came about,\\u201d she says. While coffee continues to be grown in large plantations, many coffee farmers cultivate coffee on very small tracts of land, making them especially vulnerable to the vagaries of Nature, including climate change, since coffee is especially susceptible to rising temperatures and rainfall pattern fluctuations. \\u201cSmallholder farmers are always more vulnerable in the face of any kind of natural disaster, and that is true of coffee as well,\\u201d she says. Arshiya Bose\\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \\n                                Special Arrangement Working with more farmers, therefore, is high on the list of Black Baza\\u2019s priorities, and Arshiya hopes that the recent SCA recognition can help them achieve this goal. \\u201cOne of the ways we think of doing this is to develop a green coffee programme, and I think something like SCA enables us to now try to  look for partners overseas,\\u201d she says, adding that getting into coffee exports would allow them to work with even more farmers. \\u201cWe have also started expanding beyond coffee into other products that our farmers grow, including cardamom and pepper, and hope to open a couple of caf\\u00e9s soon, as well.\\u201d To know more, log intohttps://blackbazacoffee.com/ Published- April 16, 2025 04:33 pm IST climate change/Sustainability/conservation/community-led Copyright\\u00a9 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

April 21, 2025e-Paper Updated- April 21, 2025 10:03 am IST - Bengaluru Aghanashini Estuary in Uttara Kannada is one of the Ramsar sites.\\n                                          | Photo Credit: file photo Secretary General of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, Dr. Musonda Mumba, on Sunday said that India has more Ramsar sites compared to China. Dr. Mumba, participating in the Sinhasi Social Impact Conference 2 - Wetland Conservation and Climate Change, said India now has 89 Ramsar sites surpassing China which has 82 sites. \\u201cIndia now has 89 Ramsar sites, surpassing China, which has 82 Ramsar sites. The wetland sites range from mountains to the sea,\\u201d Dr. Mumba said. Speaking on the importance of wetlands, she said that they have tremendous value almost all of the world\\u2019s fresh water is drawn from them. \\u201cWetlands are the world\\u2019s largest carbon shore, they purify and filter harmful water, our food supply depends on wetlands, extreme climatic events are mitigated by wetlands, wetlands provide jobs and sustainable livelihoods, almost half of all animal species live and breed in wetlands,\\u201d she said. On the challenges faced by them and the importance of Ramsar Sites, she said there are 2,500 sites covering over 257 million hectares around the world. \\u201cThe challenge for wetlands is that they have been used historically as waste lands; as a result of this, they are being lost at an alarming rate. Around 87% of wetlands have been lost since 1700 AD. Around 35% of wetlands have been lost since 1970,\\u201d she added. She further pointed out that wetlands are being lost at a rate of three times faster than tropical forests. \\u201cAround 4,875 wetland-dependent species are threatened with extinction globally. Over 80% of wastewater is released into wetlands immediate action is required to stop this,\\u201d she said. Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest, Karnataka Forest Department, Kumar Pushkar, speaking on the occasion, said that according to the National Wetlands Atlas 2021, Karnataka has 14,936 wetlands covering 0.79 million hectares, which is 4.1% of the State\\u2019s geographical area. \\u201cWith population rising in the State, especially urban Bengaluru and nearby periurban areas like Doddaballapur, the demand for water has increased manifold. This, together with the dried-up or polluted nature of water bodies, has put high pressure on the city\\u2019s underground water table, which is now found at depths of 1500 feet in many parts. The Karnataka Forest Department is undertaking various activities for conservation and management of wetlands under its jurisdiction in Karnataka,\\u201d he said. He added that there has not been much change in the state\\u2019s wetland geographical area which is a good indicator.
